# Introducing a new program by KFMEDIA℠
---
## **TL;DR**

Create a new program that offsets economic disparity defining #Web3 participation.

---

### **Observations**

What is commonplace inside of #Web3 is western and global north thinking by founders in these regions. Too often they set a single point of entry for anyone wanting to join their efforts.

What is uncommon is how do we create pathways for people who have no access to #Web3 in other parts of the world. People who come from underdeveloped economies, who are blocked to participate by banking institutions or governmental regulations.

---
### **Objectives**

Create a pathway to remove these blockers, provide a fair exchange of value removing budgetary concerns from the equation, and provide a qualified form of participation.

Building on our reputation for creating innovative programs that maximize participation of all people without prejudice, is one of the core pillars that we stand on.

This program aims to partner directly with local community leaders. They are the best resource for their community to introduce new concepts. They can also provide direct hands on training if needed. This program will be piloted in LATAM during Q4 2024. Once we have a good assessment of how the program is working we can expand to other regions.

### **Impact Measurement**

Our direct impact will be measured by the following criteria:
1. How many new users we bring into our active learning center?
2. What is the overall success rate of course completion through assesments?
3. How many EAS certificates have been deployed?
4. What percentage of our treasury has been distributed from **Learn For Impact™?**
5. How much time learners are spending on our curated content?

### **Call to Action**

Join us in making a difference in people's lives who have little to no defined path of participation in #Web3. Any contribution helps no matter how big or small.
